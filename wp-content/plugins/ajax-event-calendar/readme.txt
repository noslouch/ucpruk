A fully localized community calendar that allows authorized users to manage events in custom categories.

== Description ==

An easy-to-use visual community calendar that allows authorized users to add, edit, move, copy, resize, delete and filter events into customizable categories - supports daily, weekly, monthly and yearly repeating events.  Calendars can be added to your site by typing "[calendar]" shortcode in the body of a page, a post or a text widget.  Event lists are similarly added via the "[eventlist]" shortcode.  Both shortcodes are highly customizable with numerous [display options](http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/wiki/ShortcodeOptions).

This plugin does not support WordPress MU.

== Installation ==

1. Follow the typical [WordPress plugin installation steps](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).
1. If you are unfamiliar with shortcode usage, [learn about shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API).
1. To create a new calendar, add the [calendar] shortcode to the body of a page, a post or a text widget.
1. As of version 1.0 [eventlist] replaces the Upcoming Events widget. To create a new event list, simply add the [eventlist] shortcode to the body of a page, a post or a text widget, there is no visible change in front-end appearance.
1. For more advanced display settings, these are the available [customization options](http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/wiki/ShortcodeOptions).
1. If you encounter issues, be sure to check out the [answers to frequently asked questions](https://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions).

**IMPORTANT !**

* When adding shortcodes to pages or posts be sure to USE THE WORDPRESS HTML EDITOR VIEW, not the Visual editor view.
* Your blog time zone option MUST BE A CITY VALUE, the plugin may not handle dates correctly when set to a numeric gmt_offset.
* PRIOR TO UPGRADING THE PLUGIN be sure to backup critical event data located in aec_event and aec_event_category tables. Select a plugin from the WordPress Plugins Repository that can backup and restore custom (non-WordPress) tables.
