DO NOT modify any of the files in this folder!  Its contents will get overwritten when the plugin
is updated.

Instead, copy this folder to wp-content/uploads/cctm (or where-ever your uploads 
folder is).  Any file inside of the config folder there will override the config 
file here.

For example, if you want to customize the configuration for the image search parameters,
you'd copy the image_search_parameters.php file from here and place it at 
wp-content/uploads/cctm/config/image_search_parameters.php

The user created files are given precedence over the system ones.
